# **Overview**
AvailData is a user-friendly, security-focused, multi-user remote access database manager that runs on a safe client application. The users and admins interact with a client application that connects to a secure server to safely control a traditionally serverless database. Their degree of access is based on the users given permissions.

Featuring: SSL Communication, a RSA Key Exchange, Mass AES Encryption, Optimised Data Buffering, a Firewall, Multi-Threading for Simultaneous User Access, Secure Login Access Controls, Table Read and Write Controls, a Modern and Reactive Client-Side GUI, and much more. AvailData's primary goal is to securely bring "Big Data" to everyone.

Many companies still rely on outdated and insecure data storage techniques that leave their data vulnerable to unauthorized access, manipulation, or theft. It seems that a lot of companies are left with the option to pay large fees for secure remote data storage, where they don't own their data, or they have to invest in expensive technical infrastructure and highly trained employees. For many companies, neither of these solutions are viable.

AvailData uses a traditionally serverless database to store data anywhere your AvailData server is hosted. To host a server, the only technical information the admin will need to know is the IP address of the host machine. There are options for additional security as well, although it's not needed to keep the database secure.

Essentially, AvailData takes a serverless database and provides everyone with a free-to-use SQlite3 database-server that mimics a fully configured MySQL remote database. It also provides a user-friendly and safe application for proper data management by non-technical users. It’s being designed to set up automatically (from server to remote application) with ease of use and little to no technical knowledge required. Say goodbye to the stress of data safety.

# **Developer Roles**
I, **Kolby MacDonald**, will be the sole developer working on the desktop application throughout the entire software development process, from concept to delivery. This approach ensures that the development process is consistent, allowing for a cohesive end product that meets all requirements and adheres to the project scope. Working independently allows for better timeline management and more dynamic work schedule, which maintains a focused approach to the development process. Moreover, working independently will streamline the development process and enable me to deliver a high-quality product efficiently. With full control over the process, I can make informed decisions and respond quickly to any changes or challenges that may arise. This approach will ultimately result in a more reliable and user-friendly desktop application that meets the needs and expectations of the end-users.
