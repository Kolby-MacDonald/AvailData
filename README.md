# **Overview**
1. **Background:**
    - Many companies still rely on outdated and insecure data storage techniques that leave their data vulnerable to unauthorised access, manipulation, or theft. An example of an improper technique still commonly used is excel spreadsheets storing client booking, payment and personal information. This can lead to serious consequences such as data breaches, identity theft, and financial loss.
2. **Description:**
    - To address this issue, AvailData is being developed as a secure data storage solution. It is a desktop application that connects users to a central MySQL Database which they can manipulate to store their data. One of the key features of AvailData is the implementation of sanitising queries. This principle helps safely guide the user when modifying their database, ensuring that their data is not vulnerable to unauthorised access or manipulation. This feature is crucial in ensuring the integrity of the data stored in the database. In addition to the principles of sanitization, AvailData will also provide a local encryption feature that uses an asymmetric encryption algorithm to create a private key for the user. This feature ensures that even if the data stored in the database is accessed by an unauthorised user, it will be encrypted and therefore, unreadable. Moreover, asymmetric key based encryption will provide the user with confidence that their data isn’t being viewed by the database managers. This further enhances the security of the data stored in the database.
3. **Intended Result:** 
    - The combination of these features creates a secure solution for storing any data that a company or person may need in a proper database. This provides users with the peace of mind that their sensitive data is protected and safe from unauthorised access, manipulation, or theft. Overall, AvailData will be a powerful tool that will help companies and individuals to store their data in a secure manner, safeguarding their privacy and confidential information.


# **Goals**
1. **Proof of Concept:**
    - Establish a connection between Python3 and an MySQL database. 
    - Proceed to develop a user database system that restricts access to created databases based on user privileges. 
    - Grant users the ability to execute queries on their respective databases. 
    - Create a registration script that populates the user table with user-provided login credentials, enforcing unique email addresses and strong password requirements.
3. **Development:**
    - Development of a desktop application that connects to a central MySQL Database.
    - Implementation of principles of sanitization to guide the user in modifying their database in a safe manner.
    - Integration of a local encryption feature that uses an asymmetric encryption algorithm to create a private key for the user, enumerate and further encrypt the database.
    - Implementation of security measures to ensure that all data is stored securely and protected from unauthorised access or manipulation
    - Creation of a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily access and manipulate their databases
    - Create an executable that packages the application together.
5. **Testing:**
    - Testing to ensure that the application is free of errors and performs efficiently.
    - Stress testing the query mechanism to guarantee SQLi is not possible.
    - Third-party testing for quality assurance.
7. **Delivering:**
    - Documentation of the application, including user guides and manuals
    - Creation of PowerPoint presentation to demonstrate the applications backend security.
    - Creating demonstration video showcasing the product.

# **Developer Roles**
I, **Kolby MacDonald**, will be the sole developer working on the desktop application throughout the entire software development process, from concept to delivery. This approach ensures that the development process is consistent, allowing for a cohesive end product that meets all requirements and adheres to the project scope. Working independently allows for better timeline management and more dynamic work schedule, which maintains a focused approach to the development process. Moreover, working independently will streamline the development process and enable me to deliver a high-quality product efficiently. With full control over the process, I can make informed decisions and respond quickly to any changes or challenges that may arise. This approach will ultimately result in a more reliable and user-friendly desktop application that meets the needs and expectations of the end-users.
